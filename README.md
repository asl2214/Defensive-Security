## Overview
For this project, we played the role of a SOC analyst at a small company called Virtual Space Industries (VSI). The scenario that was given was that a rival company called JobeCorp was rumored to launch a cyberattack on VSI. Our job was to create a SIEM that would monitor potential attacks on VSI's systems and applications. The team was given Windows Server Logs and Apache Server Logs that represented normal internet activity. The Windows Server Logs contain intellectual property of VSI's next-generation virtual reality programs while Apache Server Logs are from VSI's main public-facing website.
