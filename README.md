## Overview
For this project, we played the role of a SOC analyst at a small company called Virtual Space Industries (VSI). The scenario that was given was that a rival company called JobeCorp was rumored to launch a cyberattack on VSI. Our job was to create a SIEM that would monitor potential attacks on VSI's systems and applications. The team was given Windows Server Logs and Apache Server Logs that represented normal internet activity. The Windows Server Logs contain intellectual property of VSI's next-generation virtual reality programs while Apache Server Logs are from VSI's main public-facing website. 

## Reviewing Normal Activity Logs
We first analyzed Windows Server Logs of normal activity. The fields we looked at were signature_id, signature, user, status, and severity. Three reports were created: a report of the table of signatures and associated signature ID's, severity levels and the percentages of each level, and comparison of the success and failure of Windows activity. Three Alerts were created based on the fields of failed Windows activity, successful login signature, and deleted user account signature. 

### Reports

Table of signatures and associated signature ID's was created from the the signature_id field for identification:
